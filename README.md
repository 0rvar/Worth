# Worth

**Worth** is a data broker addon that aggregates the item and gold worth of your characters. Item worth is determined by considering vendor price, Auctioneer price and (if the character has the skill) disenchant value.
Soulbound tradeskill items like Truesteel Ingot and Gearspring Parts are valued to the crafting materials used to craft them. Primal Spirits are valued at 1/50 of a Savage Blood.
